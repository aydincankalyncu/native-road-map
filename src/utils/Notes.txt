-4. and 5. links are for style properties that supports on react native.


Flexbox:
-It has 2 axises. Cross Axis and Main Axis Flex Direction column and row. top to bottom or left to right.


-FlatList:
-It uses for very large amount of data. More powerful than scrollView because flatlist just renders the item when you need.
It makes the application much more performance.
It needs the key property. There is 2 options to set the key prop.
1. Create the data with object type and give key property and you don't need to give key property in flatlist.
2. keyExtractor field:
- Let's say we have a data which contains id field that must be unique.
- Flatlist needs the key property built in.
- you need to set 
keyExtractor={(item, index) =>{
  return item.id; // id or something else doesn't matter.
}}
